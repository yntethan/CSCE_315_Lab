          <p><strong>What Have I Worked On?</strong></p>
          <p>
              I have worked on a Innovate for Defense project, where I worked with project sponsors: DoD and 
              Essentium (3d printer company), to integrate and streamline 3d printing into the logistical processes of the Texas National Guard. 
              I created and maintained a database of part files with the relevant associated data using SQL and created the Front-end GUI 
              designed using Java with a search functionality to output the part file, the estimated printing time, 
              the estimated cost of printing and the associated required system settings for the printer to print such a part
